#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
# In particular, see
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html>
# for a complete listing of the directives available.
#
# Control the overall operation of Apache
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, log and module directories are kept.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot "/etc/apache2"

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
Listen 80

#
# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support
#
# To load modules, use the LoadModule directive.  See how various
# modules are loaded in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/.
#
Include mods-enabled/*.load
Include mods-enabled/*.conf

#
# These include statements were installed by default:
#
#Include apache2.conf

#
# User and Group: The name (or UID) and group (or GID) that the server
# uses to run.
#
User ${APACHE_RUN_USER}
Group ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}

#
# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section will affect the main server which
# responds to requests that don't match any configured <VirtualHost>.
#
# The ServerAdmin directive sets the email address that the server
# includes in error messages.
#
ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

#
# ServerName: The name and port number the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be set automatically, but we recommend specifying
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
#
#ServerName www.example.com:80

#
# The DocumentRoot directive sets the directory out of which you will serve
# your documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

#
# <Directory>: Container for directives that apply to a specific directory
# (and its subdirectories).
#
# AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
# It can be "All", "None", or any combination of keywords.
#
# Options controls which server features are available in a particular directory.
#
<Directory />
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Require all denied
</Directory>

<Directory /usr/share>
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
</Directory>

<Directory /var/www/html>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>

#
# AccessFileName: The name of the access control file (generally .htaccess).
#
AccessFileName .htaccess

#
# The <Files> and <FilesMatch> directives limit the scope of directives
# to one or more files by filename. See the documentation for
# examples of uses.
#

#
# The <If> directive encloses configuration directives that are
# processed only if the test expression is true.
#
# <If "%{HTTP_USER_AGENT} == 'BadClient/1.0'">
#   ...
# </If>

#
# The <Location> directive limits the scope of directives to a matching
# URL. It is similar to <Directory>, but it operates on the URL-space.
#
# <Location /status>
#   SetHandler server-status
#   Require ip 127.0.0.1
# </Location>

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* specify an ErrorLog directive within
# a <VirtualHost> container, that host's errors will be logged there
# and not here.
#
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

#
# LogLevel: Controls the severity of messages logged in the error log.
# Available levels: trace8, ..., trace1, debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit, alert, emerg.
#
LogLevel warn

#
# Include generic snippets of statements
#
Include conf-enabled/*.conf

#
# Enable virtual hosts
#

#
# Configure mod_status for Apache2 server statistics
#
# ExtendedStatus controls whether Apache will generate full status
# information (ExtendedStatus On) or just basic information
# (ExtendedStatus Off).
#
# ExtendedStatus On
